# MLProject
## This is an ML project to try and see if an MLP can predict a songs popularity based on Spotify metadata and use a PCA to analyze the correlations and tweak the MLP. <br>
## This project was made using Google Co-Lab so a .py file and a .ipynd file will be included.


This project used multiple different libraries that will need to be installed if you are running this project locally. I found that running Torch for my personal computer was easier on Google Colab. The libraries used are:

* [Torch](https://pytorch.org/) 
* [MatPlotLib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/install/index.html) 
* [SciKit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/install/)
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html)
